Currency Converter Web App – Real-time Exchange Rates

 responsive currency converter web app that allows users to convert values between multiple global currencies in real-time. It fetches live exchange rates using the Frankfurter API and provides a simple, intuitive user experience with dynamic form validation and interactive results. This project helped me strengthen my front-end development skills and learn how to work with APIs.
